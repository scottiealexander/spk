# spk library

A [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)® (The Mathworks, Natick, MA) package for analyzing neurophysiology data recorded using [Spike2](http://ced.co.uk/products/spike2)® (CED, Cambridge, UK).

## Set up:
* To initialize the library for use, change directory to the folder that contains the **setpath** function.
* Run the **setpath** function to add dependencies (contained in the *utils* directory) to your Matlab path
* Optionally invoke the **savepath** command to save your path for future use
